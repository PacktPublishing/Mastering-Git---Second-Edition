## Get to Know the Author
**Jakub Narebski**
 followed Git development from the very beginning of its creation. He created, announced, and analyzed the annual Git User's Surveys from 2007 till 2012 - all except the first one (you can find his analysis of those surveys on the Git wiki). He shares his expertise in the technology on the StackOverflow question-and-answer site. He is one of the editors of Git Rev News, which is a monthly digest of all things Git.
He is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland. He uses Git as his version control system of choice both for personal and professional work and teaches it to computer science students as a part of their coursework.
Jakub Narebski was one of the proofreaders of the Version Control by Example book by Eric Sink, and was the reason why it has a chapter on Git.
